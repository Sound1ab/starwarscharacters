# YFS Vue Scaffolding

A VueJS boilerplate using the following things:

* Webpack for bundling
* Babel for ES6
* ESLint for JS style enforcement
* SCSS for styling
* Jest for testing

----
## Installation

The following bash command is a quickstart for cloning the project and deleting the git repo that will be included. If you prefer another method go ahead and use that.

git clone https://bitbucket.org/digital_annexe/scaffolding_vue <PROJECT_NAME> && rm -rf <PROJECT_NAME>/.git

## Rulebook

### Vue Components
Components should be small and reusable. Rule of thumb if you ever use anything twice then it's a component.

Components live in their own directories and are likely to be accompanied by:

* A pure/presentational Vue component that takes props only.
* A higher order component that handles the getting and digesting of data before passing props to the pure component.
* A .spec.js file for testing the component

### Styles
This setup assumes that you will be leveraging in-component styling. The src/scss directory is the location for all global styles, mixins and configuration objects. Those styles ar available everywhere so you do not need to follow a pattern of @importing stuff for every `<style>` section of your components. This globality is achieved by adding the stylesheet to the scss loader definition in build/utils.

### State management
You can feel free to include whichever form of state management tool is required for your project. Vuex is not included by default because it is not required for every project and would be an example of bloat.
